# 🎲 Pig Game (Vanilla JavaScript)

A classic **two-player dice game** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
Players take turns rolling a dice and try to be the first to reach **100 points**.

## 📌 Project Description

This Pig Game is a browser-based game where each player can roll a dice to gain points or hold their current score.  
If a player rolls a **1**, their current score is lost and the turn switches to the other player.
